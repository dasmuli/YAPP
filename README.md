# YAPP

Third project planner, this time using mobile only, testing vue.js. The result is located [here](https://zerozerozero.dd-dns.de/YAPP). This can be installed as an app on a mobile phone using a browser.

After one year of using the app, I do not have a clue of how to setup npm, vue or anything. But it is a lightweight app, it just works and the it supports multiple projects. Nice and easy.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/)
